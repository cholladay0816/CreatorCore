# Contributing to CreatorCore
Thank you so much for contributing!  Here are a few guidelines to make 

## Guidelines
1. Keep changes small.
We appreciate any change, regardless if it fixes a breaking bug or improves documentation or comments.  Your work is incredibly important to us, and much appreciated.

2. Make sure your contributions pass our integration tests.
At this time, we do not accept breaking changes.  Please review our tests, documentation, and the results of your PR to make sure your changes are compatible with our project.

3. Do not push to the `main` branch.
We like to heavily test our changes before we merge them onto the live servers.  Please use `develop` for new changes.

That's all!  Thanks again for your support.
